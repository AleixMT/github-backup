If you are using this script in a workflow set the environment variable GH_TOKEN with your GitHub token for
the authentication. You can do so by declaring it in your environment variables, in your bashrc or by setting it
before calling the script:

GH_TOKEN=\"your_github_secret_token\" ./cloneAll.sh

If you are using this script in a user environment you can also issue the command \"gh auth login\" to provide the
authentication.

If you are running from Docker or from a workflow it is likely that you did not set the GH_TOKEN_FILE environment
variable, which is the standard way of passing the token to the workflow or container. You can do so by creating a
GitHub token and putting it into secrets/GH_TOKEN.txt"
